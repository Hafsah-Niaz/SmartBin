## 🌷 Project Overview

The **SmartBin IoT Monitoring System** is an intelligent waste management web app designed to monitor the **garbage levels** of multiple bins in real time.  
Each bin is equipped with a **sensor** that measures its fill level and sends data to **Firebase**, which powers the **live monitoring dashboard**.

The system ensures timely garbage collection, prevents overflow, and enhances urban waste management through automation and real-time data visualization.

## 🌺 Key Features

🌸 **Real-time Garbage Monitoring**  
Each smart bin continuously measures its garbage level and sends data to Firebase via Wi-Fi.

🌼 **Dynamic Dashboard**  
A centralized **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript dashboard** displays live bin data with color-coded indicators:
- 🟢 **Below 50%:** Safe  
- 🟡 **50%–80%:** Getting Full  
- 🔴 **Above 80%:** Overflow Alert  

🌹 **Bin Identification**  
Each bin has a **unique ID** and **location**, allowing easy recognition and management on the dashboard.

🌷 **QR-based Complaint System**  
Every bin includes a **QR code** linked to a **complaint form**, enabling users to report issues instantly.  
Complaints are stored and shown directly in the dashboard for admin response.

🌸 **Firebase Integration**  
Data is synced through **Firebase Realtime Database**, ensuring instant updates between bins and the dashboard.
